# HOWTO

- in public/music put your MP3s, in public/videos put your MP4s.
- node server.js to start the server
- the client visits http://localhost:8080/ 
- the admin selects remote song/video from http://localhost:8080/admin123

# Note

- this app was built in an hour (mostly with copy-pasting stuff), so the code isn't that nicely written :D
